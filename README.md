# Techloop Component Bank

### Introduction
IEEE VIT SB maintains an inventory of electric components and issue them to its Techloop E+ members upon request through the application authorised by the admin. The iOS application created keeps track of the borrowed components by a IEEE member and shows the inventory maintained by the organisation. Some of the electronic components are expensive to purchase and to innovate projects based on IoT and other domains that may include use of electric components, these can be borrow by a member for short duration to progress further.
